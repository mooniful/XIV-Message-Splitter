XIV Message Splitter is a tool that splits up input text into chunks that fit inside a single FFXIV chat message.

This is useful for roleplaying, where one may type more text than can fit into a message.

XIV Message Splitter is a simple .html file which uses JavaScript for the logic.

Tools like this already exist, however this tool is nice for those who write in external web-based programs such as Google Docs and prefer a tool to use in the same browser window, without cluttering up the game window.

XIV Message Splitter was also written with the help of ChatGPT.
