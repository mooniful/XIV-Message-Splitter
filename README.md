XIV Message Splitter is a simple HTML + Javascript utility for splitting up text into chunks that fit inside a single FFXIV chat message. This is mostly useful for roleplaying.

This tool is ideal for players who write their messages in web-based text editors and prefer a splitting tool in the same browser window that also doesn't clutter up the game window.

XIV Message Splitter was written mostly with the help of ChatGPT.
